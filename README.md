# LZW-PDF-Compression
Java program which compresses a book using the LZW algorithm and compares the file type sizes of the book.
There are two folders, one with the inputs to test for the book "The Catcher in the Rye" (text-only pdf) and another with the inputs for the book "The Little Prince" (image-heavy pdf).
To test one of these two books all you need to do is place the files from the chosen book's folder directly in the root folder of the project (TOR3-Project/) and simply run the project in your favorite IDE.
Have fun!
