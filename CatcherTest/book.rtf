I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for.

He told us we should always pray to God--talk to Him and all-- wherever we were. He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car. That killed me. I just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it. He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart. It was a very crude thing to do, in chapel and all, but it was also quite amusing. Old Marsalla. He damn near blew the roof off. Hardly anybody laughed out loud, and old Ossenburger made out like he didn't even hear it, but old Thurmer, the headmaster, was sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all, and you could tell he heard it. Boy, was he sore. He didn't say anything then, but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made a speech.

My brother gave me a book by Ring Lardner for my birthday, just before I went to Pencey. It had these very funny, crazy plays in it, and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl that's always speeding. Only, he's married, the cop, so be can't marry her or anything. Then this girl gets killed, because she's always speeding. That story just about killed me. What I like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while. I read a lot of classical books, like The Return of the Native and all, and I like them, and I read a lot of war books and mysteries and all, but they don't knock me out too much. What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though. I wouldn't mind calling this Isak Dinesen up. And Ring Lardner, except that D.B. told me he's dead. You take that book Of Human Bondage, by Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last summer. It's a pretty good book and all, but I wouldn't want to call Somerset Maugham up.

We were the only ones in the can, because everybody was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off--this nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling 'Song of India" while he shaved. He had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler, like "Song of India" or "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue." He could really mess a song up.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\fi720\ri389\sl240\slmult1\sb1\f0\fs24\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well, so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself. He thought he was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was pretty handsome, too--I'll admit it.

I'm not too crazy about describing rooms and houses anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt. It was a very descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed fielder's mitt. He was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though, was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink. He wrote them on it so that he'd have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat. He's dead now.

He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had. I started playing golf when I was only ten years old. I remember once, the summer I was around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a sudden, I'd see Allie. So I did, and sure enough, he was sitting on his bike outside the fence--there was this fence that went all around the course--and he was sitting there, about a hundred and fifty yards behind me, watching me tee off. That's the kind of red hair he had. God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair. I was only thirteen, and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 windows with my\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken and everything by that time, and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll admit, but I hardly didn't even know I was doing it, and you didn't know Allie.

For instance, that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face, she was pretty good-looking. I mean that's my big trouble. In my mind, I'm probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw. Sometimes I can think of very crumby stuff I wouldn't mind doing if the opportunity came up. I can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun, in a crumby way, and if you were both sort of drunk and all, to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each other's face. The thing is, though, I don't like the idea. It stinks, if you analyze it. I think if you don't really like a girl, you shouldn't horse around with her at all, and if you do like her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it, like squirting water all over it. It's really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes. Girls aren't too much help, either, when you start trying not to get too crumby, when you start trying not to spoil anything really good. I knew this one girl, a couple of years ago, that was even crumbier than I was. Boy, was she crumby! We had a lot of fun, though, for a while, in a crumby way. Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away. Last year I made a rule that I was going to quit horsing around with girls that, deep down, gave me a pain in the ass. I broke it, though, the same week I made it--the same night, as a matter of fact. I spent the whole night necking with a terrible phony named Anne Louise Sherman. Sex is something I just don't understand. I swear to God I don't.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\fi720\ri439\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs24\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 I started toying with the idea, while I kept standing there, of giving old Jane a buzz--I\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 mean\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 calling\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 her\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 long\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 distance\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 at\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 B.M.,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 where\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 she\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 went,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 instead\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 of\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 calling\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 up\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 her mother\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 to\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 find\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 out\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 when\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 she\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 was\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 coming\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 home.\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 You\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 weren't\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 supposed\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 to\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 call\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 students\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 up late at night, but I had it all figured out.

Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole goddam movie by heart, because I've taken her to see it about ten times. When old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he's running away from the cops and all, Phoebe'll say right out loud in the movie--right when the Scotch guy in the\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 picture says it--"Can you eat the herring?" She knows all the talk by heart. And when this professor in the picture, that's really a German spy, sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old Phoebe beats him to it--she holds up her little finger at me in the dark, right in front of my face. She's all right. You'd like her. The only trouble is, she's a little too affectionate sometimes. She's very emotional, for a child. She really is. Something else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she doesn't finish them. They're all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield--only old Phoebe spells it "Hazle." Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She's supposed to be an orphan, but her old man keeps showing up. Her old man's always a "tall attractive gentleman about 20 years of age." That kills me. Old Phoebe. I swear to God you'd like her. She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid.

She'd wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a lady and all. And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in general, old Phoebe'd be listening. Sometimes you'd forget she was around, because she was such a little kid, but she'd let you know. She'd interrupt you all the time.

She called up Jane's mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived in the house next to ours, but I'd never conversed with her before or anything. She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her that I didn't give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Jane and I got to be friends and all. I played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I improved her game immensely, though. I'm a very good golfer.

I'd just stand there, trying to look tough. What I might do, I might say something very cutting and snotty, to rile him up--instead of socking him in the jaw. Anyway if I did say something very cutting and snotty, he'd probably get up and come over to me and say, "Listen, Caulfield. Are you calling me a crook?" Then, instead of\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 saying,\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 "You're\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 goddam\expnd-1\expndtw-5  \expnd0\expndtw0 right\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 I\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 am,\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 you\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 dirty\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 crooked\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 bastard!"\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 all\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 I\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 probably\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 would've said would be, "All I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes." Right away then, the guy would know for sure that I wasn't going to take a sock at him, and he probably would've said, "Listen. Let's get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?" Then I probably would've said, "Nobody's calling anybody a thief. All I know is my gloves were in your goddam galoshes." It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I'd leave his room without even taking a sock at him. I'd probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror. Anyway, that's what I thought about the whole way back to the hotel. It's no fun to he yellow. Maybe I'm\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 not all yellow. I don't know. I think maybe I'm just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn't give much of a damn if they lose their gloves. One of my troubles is, I never care too much when I lose something--it used to drive my mother crazy when I was a kid. Some guys spend days looking for something they lost. I never seem to have anything that if I lost it I'd care too much. Maybe that's why I'm partly yellow. It's no excuse, though. It really isn't. What you should be is not yellow at all. If you're supposed to sock somebody in the jaw, and you sort of feel like doing it, you should do it. I'm just no good at it, though. I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights. I don't mind getting hit so much--although I'm not crazy about it, naturally--but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy's face. I can't stand looking at the other guy's face, is my trouble. It wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something. It's a funny kind of yellowness, when you come to think of it, but it's yellowness, all right. I'm not kidding myself.\par\sect\sectd\sbkpage\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\fi720\ri375\sl240\slmult1\sb76\f0\fs24\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 The more I thought about my gloves and my yellowness, the more depressed I\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 got, and I decided, while I was walking and all, to stop off and have a drink somewhere.

Then I put on another clean shirt. I knew I didn't have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything, but it sort of gave me something to do. I was a little nervous. I was starting to feel pretty sexy and all, but I was a little nervous anyway. If you want to know the truth, I'm\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 a virgin. I really am. I've had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and all, but I've never got around to it yet. Something always happens. For instance, if you're at a girl's house, her parents always come home at the wrong time--or you're afraid they will. Or if you're in the back seat of somebody's car, there's always somebody's date in the front seat--some girl, I mean--that always wants to know what's going on all over the whole goddam car. I mean some girl in front keeps turning around to see what the hell's going on. Anyway, something always happens. I came quite close to doing it a couple of times, though. One time in particular, I remember. Something went wrong, though --I don't even remember what any more. The thing is, most of the time when you're coming pretty close to doing it with a girl--a girl that isn't a prostitute or anything, I mean--she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don't. I can't help it. You never know whether they really want you to stop, or whether they're just scared as hell, or whether they're just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it, the blame'll be on you, not them. Anyway, I keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so dumb and all. After you neck them for a while, you can really watch them losing their brains. You take a girl when she really gets passionate, she just hasn't any brains.

I figured if she was a prostitute and all, I could get in some practice on her, in case I ever get married or anything. I worry about that stuff sometimes. I read this book once, at the Whooton School, that had this very sophisticated, suave, sexy guy in it. Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still remember. It was a lousy book, but this Blanchard guy was pretty good. He had this big ch\uc1\u226 ?teau and all on the Riviera, in Europe, and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club. He was a real rake and all, but he knocked women out. He said, in this one part, that a woman's body is like a violin and all, and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right.

All they did was keep letting Him down. I like almost anybody in the Bible better than the Disciples. If you want to know the truth, the guy I like best in the Bible, next to Jesus, was that lunatic and all, that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones. I like him ten times as much as the Disciples, that poor bastard. I used to get in quite a few arguments about\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 it, when I was at Whooton School, with this boy that lived down the corridor, Arthur Childs. Old Childs was a Quaker and all, and he read the Bible all the time. He was a\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 very nice kid, and I liked him, but I could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 the\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 Bible,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 especially\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 the\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 Disciples.\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 He\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 kept\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 telling\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 me\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 if\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 I\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 didn't\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 like\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 the\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 Disciples,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 then I didn't like Jesus and all. He said that because Jesus picked the Disciples, you were supposed to like them. I said I knew He picked them, but that He picked them at random. I said He didn't have time to go around analyzing everybody. I said I wasn't blaming\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 Jesus or anything. It wasn't His fault that He didn't have any time. I remember I asked old Childs if he thought Judas, the one that betrayed Jesus and all, went to Hell after he committed suicide. Childs said certainly. That's exactly where I disagreed with him. I\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 said I'd bet a thousand bucks that Jesus never sent old Judas to Hell. I still would, too, if I had a thousand bucks. I think any one of the Disciples would've sent him\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 to Hell and all-- and fast, too--but I'll bet anything Jesus didn't do it. Old Childs said the trouble with me was that I didn't go to church or anything. He was right about that, in a way. I don't. In\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 the first place, my parents are different religions, and all the children in our family are atheists. If you want to know the truth, I can't even stand ministers. The ones they've had at every school I've gone to, they all have these Holy Joe voices when they start giving their sermons. God, I hate that. I don't see why the hell they can't talk in their natural voice.

Mine came from Mark Cross, and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap, and I guess they cost quite a pretty penny. But it was a funny thing. Here's what happened. What I did, I finally put my suitcases under my bed, instead of on the rack, so that old Slagle wouldn't get a goddam inferiority complex about it. But here's what he did. The day after I put mine under my\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 bed, he took them\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 out and put them\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 back on the rack. The reason he did it, it took me a while to find out, was because he wanted people to think my bags were his. He really did. He was a very funny guy, that way. He was always saying snotty things about them, my suitcases, for instance. He kept saying they were too new and bourgeois. That was his favorite goddam word. He read it somewhere or heard it somewhere. Everything I had was bourgeois as hell. Even my fountain pen was bourgeois. He borrowed it off me all the time, but it was bourgeois anyway. We only roomed together about two months. Then we both asked to be moved. And the funny thing was, I sort of missed him after we moved, because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes. I wouldn't be surprised if he missed me, too. At first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois, and I didn't give a damn--it was sort of funny, in fact. Then, after a while, you could tell he wasn't kidding any more. The thing is, it's really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs--if yours are really good ones and theirs aren't. You\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 think\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 if\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 they're\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 intelligent\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 and\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 all,\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 the\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 other\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 person,\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 and\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 have\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 a\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 good\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 sense\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 of\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 humor, that they don't give a damn whose suitcases are better, but they do.

He told me he went to the Nationals at Forest Hills every summer, and I told him I did too, and then we talked about certain hot-shot tennis players for quite a while. He knew quite a lot about tennis, for a kid his age. He really did.

He was walking in the street, instead of on the sidewalk, but right next to the curb. He was making out like he was walking a very straight line, the way kids do, and the whole time he kept singing and humming. I got up closer so I could hear what he was singing. He was singing that song, "If a body catch a body coming through the rye." He had a pretty little voice, too. He was just singing for the hell of it, you could tell. The cars zoomed by, brakes screeched all over the place, his parents paid no attention to him, and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing "If a body catch a body coming through the rye."

It was a benefit performance or something. I didn't much want to see it, but I knew old Sally, the queen of the phonies, would start drooling all over the place when I told her I had tickets for that, because the Lunts were in it and all. She liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all, with the Lunts and all. I don't. I don't like any shows very much, if you want to know the truth. They're not as bad as movies, but they're certainly nothing to rave about. In the first place, I hate actors. They never act like people. They just think they do. Some of the good ones do, in a very slight way, but not in a way that's fun to watch. And if any actor's really good, you can always tell he knows he's good, and that spoils it.

He was too much like a goddam general, instead of a sad, screwed-up type guy. The best part in the whole picture was when old Ophelia's brother--the one that gets in the duel with Hamlet at the very end-- was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice. While the father kept giving him a lot of advice, old Ophelia was sort of horsing around with her brother, taking his dagger out of the holster, and teasing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was shooting. That was nice. I got a big bang out of that. But you don't see that kind of stuff much. The only thing old Phoebe liked was when Hamlet patted this dog on the head.

There was one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe, with a mask on. He was the witch doctor. He gave me the creeps, but I liked him anyway. Another thing, if you touched one of the paddles or anything while you were passing, one of the guards would say to you, "Don't touch anything, children," but he always said it in a nice voice, not like a goddam cop or anything. Then you'd pass by this big glass case, with Indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a fire, and a squaw weaving a blanket. The squaw that was weaving the blanket was sort of bending over, and you could see her bosom and all. We all used to sneak a good look at\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 it, even the girls, because they were only little kids and they didn't have any more bosom than we did. Then, just before you went inside the auditorium, right near the doors, you passed this Eskimo.

There were even more upstairs, with deer inside them drinking at water holes, and birds flying south for the winter. The birds nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wires, and the ones in back were just painted on the wall, but they all looked like they were really flying south, and if you bent your head down and\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 sort of looked at them\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 upside down, they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south. The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody'd move. You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish, the birds would still be on their way south, the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole, with their pretty antlers and their pretty, skinny legs, and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket. Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be different would be you. Not that you'd be so much older or anything. It wouldn't be that, exactly. You'd just be different, that's all. You'd have an overcoat on this time. Or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and you'd have a new partner. Or you'd have a substitute taking the class, instead of Miss Aigletinger. Or you'd heard your\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom. Or you'd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them. I mean you'd be different in some way--I can't explain what I mean.

He had one of these very raspy voices, and he never stopped talking, practically. He never stopped talking, and what was awful was, he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place. But he could do one thing. The sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody I ever heard. He'd be making his bed, or hanging up stuff in the closet--he was always hanging up stuff in the closet--it drove me crazy--and he'd be whistling while he did it, if he wasn't talking in this raspy voice. He could even whistle classical stuff, but most of the time he just whistled jazz. He could take something very jazzy, like "Tin Roof Blues," and whistle it so nice and easy--right\par\sect\sectd\sbkpage\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\ri358\sl240\slmult1\sb76\f0\fs24\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 while he was hanging stuff up in the closet--that it could kill you.\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 Naturally, I never told him\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 I\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 thought\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 he\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 was\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 a\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 terrific\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 whistler.\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 I\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 mean\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 you\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 don't\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 just\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 go\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 up\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 to\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 somebody\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 and\expnd0\expndtw-2  \expnd0\expndtw0 say, "You're a terrific whistler."

His name was George something--I don't even remember--and he went to Andover. Big, big deal. You should've seen him when old Sally asked him how he liked the play. He was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebody's question. He stepped back, and stepped right on the lady's foot behind him. He probably broke every toe in her body. He said the play itself was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. Angels.

I didn't know her too well then, and I didn't think I ought to cut in on her date. She was dating this terrible guy, Al Pike, that went to Choate. I didn't know him too well, but he was always hanging around the swimming pool. He wore those white Lastex kind of swimming trunks, and he was always going off the high dive. He did the same lousy old half gainer all day long. It was the only dive he could do, but he thought he was very hot stuff. All muscles and no brains.

Jane said he wasn't a show-off. She said he had an inferiority complex. She acted like she felt sorry for him or something, and she wasn't just putting it on. She meant it. It's a funny thing about\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 girls.\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 Every\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 time\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 you\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 mention\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 some\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 guy\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 that's\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 strictly\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 a\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 bastard--very\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 mean,\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 or\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 very conceited and all--and when you mention it to the girl, she'll tell you he has an inferiority complex. Maybe he has, but that still doesn't keep him from being a bastard, in my opinion. Girls. You never know what they're going to think. I once got this girl Roberta Walsh's roommate a date with a friend of mine. His name was Bob Robinson and he really had an inferiority complex. You could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and all, because they said "he don't" and "she don't" and stuff like that and they weren't very wealthy. But he wasn't a bastard or anything. He was a very nice guy. But this Roberta Walsh's roommate didn't like him at all. She told Roberta he was too conceited--and the reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her that he was captain of the debating team. A little thing like that, and she thought he was conceited! The trouble with girls is, if they like a boy, no matter how big a bastard he is, they'll say he has an inferiority complex, and if they don't like him, no matter how nice a guy\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 he\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 is,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 or\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 how\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 big\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 an\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 inferiority\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 complex\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 he\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 has,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 they'll\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 say\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 he's\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 conceited.\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 Even\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 smart girls do it.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\fi720\ri362\sl240\slmult1\sb1\f0\fs24\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 Anyway, I gave old Jane a buzz again, but her phone didn't answer, so I had to hang up. Then I had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be available for the evening.

I keep forgetting to put people's names in. So what I did finally, I gave old Carl Luce a buzz. He graduated from the Whooton School after I left.

He was very enlightening sometimes. So I gave him a buzz. He went to Columbia now, but he lived on 65th Street and all, and I knew he'd be home. When I got him on the phone, he said he couldn't make it for dinner but that he'd meet me for a drink at ten o'clock at the Wicker Bar, on 54th. I think he was pretty surprised to hear from\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 me.

Big deal. It's supposed to be religious as hell, I know, and very pretty and all, but I can't see anything religious or pretty, for God's sake, about a bunch of actors carrying crucifixes all over the stage. When they were all finished and started going out the boxes again, you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something. I saw it with old Sally Hayes the year before, and she kept saying how beautiful it was, the costumes and all. I said old Jesus probably would've puked if He could see it--all those fancy costumes and all. Sally said I was a sacrilegious atheist. I probably am. The thing Jesus really would've liked would be the guy that plays the kettle drums in the orchestra. I've watched that guy since I was about eight years old. My brother Allie and I, if we were with our parents and all, we used to move our seats and go way down so we could watch him. He's the best drummer I ever saw. He only gets a chance to bang them a couple of times during a whole piece, but he never looks bored when he isn't doing it. Then when\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 he does bang them, he does it so nice and sweet, with this nervous expression on his face. One time when we went to Washington with my father, Allie sent him a postcard, but I'll bet he never got it.

The one that sang, old Janine, was always whispering into the goddam microphone\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 before\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 she\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 sang.\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 She'd\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 say,\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 "And\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 now\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 we\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 like\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 to\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 geeve\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 you\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 our\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 impression\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 of Vooly Voo Fransay.

Then, when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell, she'd sing some dopey song, half in English and half in French, and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy. If you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all, you got to hate everybody in the world, I swear you did. The bartender was a louse, too. He was a big snob. He didn't talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something. If you were a big shot or a celebrity or something, then he was even more nauseating. He'd go up to you and say, with this big charming smile, like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him, "Well! How's Connecticut?" or "How's Florida?" It was a terrible place, I'm not kidding.

He said his cousin was coming in to take him for a drive and all. I didn't even know he knew I had a turtleneck sweater. All I knew about him was that his name was always right ahead of me at roll call. Cabel, R., Cabel, W., Castle, Caulfield--I can still remember it.

Usually they keep yanking the kid's dress up in the back by mistake, and the kid can't dance worth a damn anyway, and it looks terrible, but I don't do it out in public with Phoebe or anything. We just horse around in the house. It's different with her anyway, because she can dance. She can follow anything you do.

But there was this one boy, Richard Kinsella.\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 He\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 didn't\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 stick\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 to\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 the\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 point\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 too\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 much,\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 and\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 they\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 were\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 always\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 yelling\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 'Digression!' at him. It was terrible, because in the first place, he was a very nervous guy--I mean he was a very nervous guy--and his lips were always shaking whenever it was his time to make a speech, and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the room. When his lips sort of quit shaking a little bit, though, I liked his speeches better than anybody else's. He practically flunked the course, though, too. He got a D plus because they kept yelling 'Digression!' at him all the time. For instance, he made this speech about this farm his father bought in Vermont. They kept yelling 'Digression!' at him the whole time he was making it, and this teacher, Mr. Vinson, gave him an F on it because he hadn't told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all. What he did was, Richard Kinsella, he'd\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 start telling you all about that stuff--then all of a sudden he'd start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle, and how his uncle got polio and all when he was forty-two years old, and how he wouldn't let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didn't want anybody to see him with a brace on. It didn't have much to do with the farm--I admit it--but it was nice. It's nice when somebody tells you about their uncle. Especially when they start out telling you about their father's farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle. I\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 mean it's dirty to keep yelling 'Digression!' at him when he's all nice and excited. I don't know. It's hard to explain." I didn't feel too much like trying, either. For one thing, I had this terrific headache all of a sudden. I wished to God old Mrs. Antolini would come in with the coffee. That's something that annoys hell out of me--I mean if somebody says\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 the coffee's all ready and it isn't.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\fi720\ri365\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs24\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 "Holden.\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 .\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 .\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 One\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 short,\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 faintly\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \expnd0\expndtw0 stuffy,\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 pedagogical\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 question.\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 Don't\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 you\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 think\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \expnd0\expndtw0 there's a time and place for everything?

All those scraggy- looking Santa Clauses were standing on corners ringing those bells, and the Salvation Army\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 girls, the ones that don't wear any lipstick or anything, were tinging bells too.

A million little kids were downtown with their mothers, getting on and off buses and coming in and out of stores. I wished old Phoebe was around. She's not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department, but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people. The Christmas before last I took her downtown shopping with me. We had a helluva time. I think it was in Bloomingdale's. We went in the shoe department and we pretended she--old Phoebe-- wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes, the kind that have about a million holes to lace up. We had the poor salesman guy going crazy. Old Phoebe tried on about twenty pairs, and each time\expnd8\expndtw40  \expnd0\expndtw0 the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up.

Then all of a sudden, something very spooky started happening. Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb, I had this feeling that I'd never get to the other side of the street.
